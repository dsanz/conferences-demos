# LIFERAY FRONTEND CONFERENCES DEMOS

Welcome to Liferay Frontend Conference Demos repository.

This repository contains each of the materials used in the Liferay Development sessions like [Dev24](https://liferay.dev/twentyfour), [DevCon](https://www.liferay.com/de/web/events/devcon/recap), [Symposium](https://www.liferay.com/events) as well as internal PoCs (proof of concept) in order to visualise and collect knowledge from Liferay Frontend Infrastructure Team. 

## Purpose
The main purpose of this repository is to share each of the materials, being PoCs as well as employees in Liferay Development sessions, to share the code material with users. 

## Structure
This repository is structured according to the projects carried out at the various Liferay Development events (`devcon/` or `dev24/`), as well as the year of their publication. In addition, each year will contain a `README.md` file with information on the name of the project, which will be linked to the video of the corresponding session and the author of the material created. Likewise, the repo will contain each of the materials used for the realisation of various PoCs. These projects are located in a directory called `PoCs/` where there is a `README.md` file with the information of the name of the project and its corresponding author.


## Questions
All questions are welcome and will be answered on a best-effort basis. To create a question, use the help of the issue indicating the repo. Notice that this repository will not keep track of any created issues.
